					Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?
					You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. 
					You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfucker.

					<p>This is still a motherfucking website.
						And it's more fucking perfect than freemium.
						Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.
						7 fucking declarations. That's how much CSS it took to turn that grotesque pile of shit into this easy-to-read masterpiece. 
						You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. And guess fucking what, you simple motherfucker...

						This is the best motherfucking website.
						And it’s fucking perfect.
						You do it every day. You take a fucking masterpiece and incrementally ruin it for the sake of design. 
						Let me remind you: design is making something for a specific purpose. 
						The essential purpose of text on a website is to be read. Stop doing shit that gets in the way. 
						Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?
